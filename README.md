## Want one?

All production files you need to build your own board can be found [here](./prod).

Gerber files as well as files needed for 3d printing are provided. Please note that the case design that supports the acryl layin may not be SLN printable. Please print them either in resin or nylon. I've used JLCPCBs printing service (black resin) and it turned out very good, so maybe take a look at that option.

Parts needed beside the MCU board and pcbs:

- a 20pin 0.5mm pitch FCC/FCP Connector

- 38 mx hotswap sockets

- 38 1N4148 diodes in SOT-123 package

- 38 of your favourite switches
